All these files are auto-generated whenever we created Axis client-service from client side
after creating services in server.

MyLittleStub.java is a client model of the service. Its function is to convert
the Java objects that are modeled in the client requests to XML message and sends
it to the server. The server recives the XML, creates response java object and
returns it to the caller. 

A WSDL Service is provided that understand and responds to XML message submitted
to the server.
